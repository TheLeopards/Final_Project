Downloading Landsat data from Earth Explorer/espa

The Landsat images can be downloaded via ESPA (http://espa.cr.usgs.gov/ordering/new).
You need to have an account before being able to request data to be pre-processed.

Placing your order

Once you have entered your credentials, you may upload the Scenes.txt file with the list of scenes 
used in this project that need to be pre-processed. Other dates for the same scene (row 194, 
path 28) can be added as long as they are from Landsat 5. Select input products and product 
metadata as Source Products. From the Climate Data Records select CFMask and Surface
 Reflectance. The format should be GeoTiff.

Downloading the data

Once you receive the e-mail from ESPA notifying you that your order has been pre-processed, you 
will be able to proceed to the download of the data.  The amount of scenes is large so the use of a 
download manager is highly recommended. Two options:

   -  The Bulk Download Application
    - The DownloadThemAll plugin of the firefox browser
